## Hey, this is us 👋

![An illustration showing a variety of differently themed Octocats. Monuments from different cities are indicated in the background like the Space Needle, Berlin Fernsehturm and Transamerica Pyramid.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3369400/133268513-5bfe2f93-4402-42c9-a403-81c9e86934b6.jpeg)

Yes, we are building GitHub on GitHub. In fact, we’ve been doing this since **October 19th, 2007**. That's when we made our first commit. Since then we pushed **over 2.5 million commits**, opened **over 1 million issues**, submitted roughly **650k pull requests** across **4357 repositories** from over **50 countries** 🤯. But that's just us. We are proud  to be part of the work of millions of developers, companies and robots across the solar system 🪐. Yes, [Robots](https://github.com/readme/featured/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter)!

### 🍿 An interconnected community

The open source community is the 💗 heart of GitHub and fundamental to how we build software today. See for yourself:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) helped support more than **5k** individuals and projects around the world 🌍
- Open source projects on GitHub received a stunning **218 million** contributions 🚀 in the last year alone
- **Every minute** a developer creates a new release 🏄 for a public project on GitHub

Now that we are talking about the important things ☝️, are you contributing to open source? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started! Open source software is made by people just like you. Learn more about [how to contribute](https://opensource.guide/).

### 🦦 Contributing to the ecosystem

We contribute to the tools 🔧 we rely on to build and run GitHub, while also maintaining 🧙‍♂️ our own open source projects like:

- [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) - A command line tool for GitHub
- [Git Large File Storage](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs) - A git extension for versioning large files
- [Primer](https://github.com/primer/css) - The GitHub design system

- *Let me know of more!*


## Why?

Got some *killer app*, some *neat project*, a cool portfolio? Make an easy single-page site to show it all off. SinglePaged uses jekyll niceties to make a ***polished, modular, and beautiful* single page site**.

- Each vertical section is a markdown file in **_posts/** directory.
  * They're sorted by 'date'. (we don't use date anywhere, it only sorts)
- Each vertical section sets it's own **color**, **header icon** (or image), **title**, and easy-to-write markdown body.
- Only **two things** to edit:
  1. Edit `_config.yml` to set the site title, description, etc
  2. Add _posts/*.md to make each vertical section. Copy some examples and add the sections from your README.md for a fast start!
- Easy adding of **SEO terms**, **favicon** & such, and **google analytics token**.

Sound good? Let's go!

There are three way to get started: (links jump to that section)

1. Make a [**user homepage**](#setup-as-user-homepage) (or organization)
2. Make a [**standalone project**](#setup-as-standalone-project-page) page
3. Make a [site under an **existing project**](#setup-inside-existing-project)



-------------------------

## Setup as user homepage

- Go click **fork** on the [github project page](https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged)
- Rename your new repository to `**username**.github.io`. (click settings in the right column)
- Clone your repository, **cd into the project**
- Run `git checkout publish && git branch -m master && git push -u origin master && git branch -D gh-pages` to get the *publish* branch as master for a clean, empty starting point.
- On your github project page go to *settings* again and change your **default branch** to ***master***
- Run `git push origin --delete gh-pages` to delete your remote's development branch

Now hop over to [Usage](#usage) to get it running with your own stuff!

**When you publish changes use `git push -u origin master`**

-------------------------


## Setup as standalone project page

- Go click **fork** on the [github project page](https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged)
- Rename your new repository to `whatever you want`. (click settings in the right column)
  * It will go live at yourusername.github.io/**WhateverYouWant**
- Clone your repository, cd into the project
- Run `git checkout publish && git branch -D gh-pages && git branch -m gh-pages && git push -uf origin gh-pages` to swap the *publish* and *gh-pages* branch.

Now hop over to [Usage](#usage) to get it running with your own stuff!

**When you publish changes use `git push -u origin gh-pages`**

-------------------------


## Setup inside existing project

This is the most complicated use-case .. but it's the coolest.
Say you've got your kickass project `github.com/t413/kicker` and want to have
some web presence to post about on [hacker news](http://news.ycombinator.com).
This will create an orphan branch called `gh-pages` in your repository
where you can publish changes, posts, images, and such. It won't alter your code at all.

- `cd` into your project on the command line
- use `git remote add -t publish singlepage git@github.com:t413/SinglePaged.git` to get access to this repository.
- use `git fetch singlepage publish:gh-pages` to fetch the remote branch
- use `git branch --set-upstream-to gh-pages singlepage/publish && git checkout gh-pages;`
  This creates and checks out an orphan branch called gh-pages that tracks the original and lets you make changes.
- When you run `git push origin gh-pages` it'll be live at *yourusername.github.io/repositoryName*

Now hop over to [Usage](#usage) to get it running with your own stuff!

**When you publish changes use `git push -u origin gh-pages`**



  ---

  #### A new section- oh the humanity!
~~~

**Note:** That part `fa-icon: paint-brush` will use a font-awesome icon of [paint-brush](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/paint-brush/). You can use any icon from this [font-awesome icon directory](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/).

- install Jekyll with `sudo gem install github-pages`
- run `jekyll serve -w`
  - visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to see a live locally served preview.
- Push changes and see them live!




## Changing your colors

- In each post file you can define `bg: mycolor` and `color: myothercolor` to change the background and text colors for that section.
- **mycolor** can be a quoted html color like `'#0fbfcf'` or a key to a special color defined in **_config.yml** under 'colors'.
  - **Note:** Changes to _config.yml require a manual restart to your local server with `^C` and `jekyll serve -w`.

Nifty, right!



## Updating

So you've got a copy running and there's some new update? Let's update!

1. Checkout your github-pages branch
  - `git checkout gh-pages` for a standalone or existing page
  - `git checkout master` for a *username.github.io* page
2. run `git remote | grep -q "singlepage" || git remote add -t publish singlepage https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged.git` to be sure you have access to this repository (you can run this command at any time).
2. `git fetch singlepage` to fetch-in-place new changes.
3. Update to the new base (using merge)
    1. `git merge singlepage/publish`
4. You can alternatively update using rebase. This *rewrites history* (**bad**), but it is cleaner.
    1. `git rebase singlepage/publish`

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/tatsy/markdown-it-responsive/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/tatsy/markdown-it-responsive)

> A markdown-it plugin for responsive images. This plugin overloads original image renderer of markdown-it.

## Usage

### Enable plugin

```js
var md = require('markdown-it')({
  html: true,
  linkify: true,
  typography: true
}).use(require('markdown-it-responsive'), options);  // <-- this use(package_name) is required
```

### How to specify options?

The notation to specify responsive sizes is as follows.

```js
var option = { responsive: {
    'srcset': {
      'header-*': [ {
        width: 320,
        rename: {
          suffix: '-small'
        }
      }, {
        width: 640,
        rename: {
          suffix: '-medium'
        }
      } ]
    },
    'sizes': {
      'header-*': '(min-width: 36em) 33.3vw, 100vw'
    }
  }
};
```

### Example

With the options above, a markdown

```md
![test](header-test.png)
```

is rendered as

```html
<p><img src="header-test.png" srcset="header-test-small.png 320w, header-test-medium.png 640w" sizes="(min-width: 36em) 33.3vw, 100vw" alt="test"></p>
```
